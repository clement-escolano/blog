I finally did it.

# Why?

Long-time lurker on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com) and Reddit (the [old](https://old.reddit.com) one), I always found, when reading blog posts, something more than just the content.
Reading a blog post shared by someone far away is the accomplishment of the Internet, and it feels magic to me.
Every time I read a story on the Internet, I wanted to be part of it, I wanted to also share my stories, I wanted to be part of the [1%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule).

But finding something interesting to write about is challenging, and writing it in a way that other people find interesting is even more challenging.
I had a few ideas from time to time but the [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) stroke every time.
After a few years working in web development, I now think I have stories of interest and I have taken the plunge.

# What?

Most of the stories I have to share are about my experience as a web developer.
Tricky bugs, useful patterns, interesting open-source projects, everything that comes out of the ordinary.

I may share from time to time some stories on other topics but it will probably relate to programming in some way.

# How?

As a web developer, writing a blog is an opportunity to ~~spend an enormous amount of time on small details~~ learn new technologies.
Besides the content, I wanted my blog website to be fast, simple and easy to maintain. Probably some sort of [cold-blooded software](https://dubroy.com/blog/cold-blooded-software/).

Reviewing the [various static site generators](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/04/18/comparing-static-site-generators/), I ended up with [Zola](http://getzola.org/).
After spending ~~hours~~ some time with the various settings and configuring the theme, it was time for the first post (no blank page anxiety for this one).

# Final thoughts

That's it, I hope you will enjoy the stories and I am proud to finally be part of the [small web](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/).

I finally did it.
